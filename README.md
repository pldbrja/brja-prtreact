# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio that utilizes React to create a single-page application. The application relies on conditional rendering to detect status and state of the current page in order to render each individual component.

## Components

Aside from Bootstrap's prebuilt classes, this portfolio utilizes the React library Material UI for specific elements such as the error message presented on the contact form.

## Errors

The dropdown menu for mobile is a work in progress and at the moment, the pprtfolio page does not render the projects correctly.

Both of these are errors that will be fixed before the final version.

## Usage

`npm i`

`npm start`

## Credits

* Material UI, which can be found at [mui.com/](https://mui.com/)
* [Graphic Placeholder](https://freesvg.org/graphic-placeholder) from FreeSVG
